# Trie Data Structure 🌳
The Trie data structure is used to store and retrieve book titles in the library. The Trie is a tree-like data structure that allows for efficient prefix searches and string matching. 

Each node in the Trie represents a character in the book title, and the edges represent the connections between characters.
